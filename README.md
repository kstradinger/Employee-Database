# Employee-Database
This script creates tables and imports CSVs of data for a fictional company, including employees, deprtments, salaries, etc.  After importing the data into tables a series of increasingly complex SQL queries are made.  There is a database schema map as well to help visualize the DB.  SQLalchemy and postgresql are used here.
